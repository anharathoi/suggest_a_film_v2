# Movie recommendation app in terminal

## Configuration
- install postgresql on your machine
- run bundle to install required gems
- run these three files in order:
  - Movie.rb file to save movie data in the db
  - User.rb file to save all user data in the db
  - Rating.rb file to save all rating data in the db (this one takes some time as the dataset is large)
- Run the all_to_hash.rb. Again, this file takes upto 3-5 minutes on my laptop(might take more or less time depending on the machine)

## Run the app
- To run the main app run main.rb
